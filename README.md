### Hi, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Owner of Jackson & Company, a technology firm that specializes in software development, startup advisory, and AI strategy. I'm currently researching the application of generative LLMs in error proofing medical transcriptions, and producing accurate clinician notes and summaries

I'm also the founder of MemphisMagic, a record label that produces electronic, symphonic, and sample-based hip hop.

Outside of tech and music, you can catch me running and cycling around Washington, DC. Supporting local non-profits, and going on adventures with my wife and cat.
