### Hi, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Owner of Jackson & Company, a technology firm that specializes in software development, startup advisory, and AI strategy. I'm currently working on a research project to determine the efficacy of using fine-tuned LLMs for error-proofing/auditing medical transcriptions and clinician summaries in order to reduce administrative overhead.

Previously, I worked at a company that engineered custom devices with built-in NVIDIA-powered AI chips and depth sensing cameras used for analyzing human motion and objects on a factory floor in real time.

I have other past experiences working in organizations innovating in the domains of Artificial Intelligence, Sustainability, and Medical Education, as well as other larger product/consumer focused companies.

Outside of tech, you can catch me producing music, running and cycling around Washington, supporting local non-profits, and going on extensive travels with my wife.
